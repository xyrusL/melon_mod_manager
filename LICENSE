                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to
make sure it remains free software for all its users.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on the same freedoms to the
recipients. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  it, provided that you retain all copyright notices.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  License (GPL v3), and give prominent credit to the original project.

  6. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the rights granted under
  this License.

  7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
  APPLICABLE LAW. THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS"
  WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
